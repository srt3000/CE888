To train YOLO v3 file,  
This google drive folder contains necessary files to run the program : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S-mOHf5OEqU2JBgp28Uyon3A0i3-r3w7?usp=sharing


Step 1: Labelled the images using Labelimg software is uploaded as images.zip in yolov3 folder in google drive
Step 2: For this project, Google colab is used. open Train_Yolo the ipynb file to the colab.  
Step 3: Prepare the google drive folder by uploading the training data containing labels and the testing data in yolov3 folder
Step 4: Specify the file paths in the program file to import the images for training, testing and also to import configuration files
Step 5: Upload the configuration file to the yolov3 folder and specify its path in the program 
Step 6: Train the images and check after each 1000 iterations if the model is saving the weights
Step 7: After finishing the training, test the program in the test set.
Step 8: The images that has Fire are shown with bounding box around Fire along with a text and the confidence and the area of the bounding box is printed on the top of images


To use Firevsnonfire Approach2.ipynb.
Upload the unzipped dataset to the google drive folder, mount the drive and change the file paths in the program
